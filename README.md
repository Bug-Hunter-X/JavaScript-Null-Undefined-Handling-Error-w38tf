# JavaScript Null/Undefined Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: forgetting to handle null or undefined values.  Failing to handle these values can lead to unexpected runtime errors. The solution shows how to correctly check and handle these cases, leading to more robust and reliable code.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a function that doesn't properly handle null or undefined values as arguments.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, which explicitly checks for null values and handles them appropriately before proceeding with the main logic of the function.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run each file and compare the outputs to see the difference in behavior. The solution will demonstrate handling of null values preventing unexpected errors.
